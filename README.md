<h1 align="center"> Wildfire Impact Assessment and Risk Mapping in Los Angeles By a GIS based approach</h1>

<br>


### Project Overview

This repository details a comprehensive study on **Wildfire Impact Assessment and Risk Mapping in Los Angeles**, conducted by a team of five members. Our project successfully achieved the highest available grade and addresses the increasing vulnerability of metropolitan and woodland areas, particularly in Los Angeles, to wildfires.

<br>

The core of this research employs **Remote Sensing (RS)** and **Geographic Information System (GIS)** technologies. It focuses on forecasting wildfire occurrences, analyzing prior fire history patterns, and identifying hazardous zones. We also analyzed how climate conditions favor these fires and the interdependence between wildfire spread and the vulnerability of critical infrastructures like highways and urban borders.

<br>

### Key Findings & Insights

</p>

<br>

Our findings shed light on areas highly susceptible to increased fire spread, including forest peripheries and roads. We identified challenges such as the long distances fire-eradicating hydrants sweep along coastal winds and an unequal distribution of fire stations, with more resources in less prone areas compared to highly vulnerable ones.

### Proposed Solutions

The project proposes actionable measures to enhance resilience against wildfire disasters, which include:

* Restaging of resources.
* Construction of fire protection cuttings around highways.
* Preparedness awareness programs.
* Leveraging **GIS risk mapping** in town planning and disaster management.
